  2. Explore the DataFrames using the other functions listed. Which DataFrame is “clean”, and ready for analysis? Create a variable named clean and set it equal to either 1 for df1 or 
2 for df2, depending on which DataFrame is clean.
//

                                      DEALING WITH MULTIPLE FILES
GIVEN:
import codecademylib3_seaborn
import pandas as pd
import glob
  3. We have 10 different files containing 100 students each. These files follow the naming structure: exams0.csv, exams1.csv, … up to exams9.csv. We are going to import each file using 
pandas, and combine all of the entries into one DataFrame. First, create a variable called student_files and set it equal to the glob() of all of the csv files we want to import.
//
student_files = glob.glob('exams*.csv')
  4. Create an empty list called df_list that will store all of the DataFrames we make from the files exams0.csv through exams9.csv.
//
df_list=[]
  5. Loop through the filenames in student_files, and create a DataFrame from each file. Append this DataFrame to df_list.
//
for filename in student_files:
  data = pd.read_csv(filename)
  df_list.append(data)
  6. Concatenate all of the DataFrames in df_list into one DataFrame called students.
//
students = pd.concat(df_list)
  7. Print students and the length of students. Did we get all of them?
//
print(students)
print(len(students))

                                      RESHAPING YOUR DATA
GIVEN:
import codecademylib3_seaborn
import pandas as pd
from students import students
  8. Print out the columns of students.
//
print(students.columns)                                       RESULT:
                                                              Index(['full_name', 'gender_age', 'fractions', 'probability', 'grade'], dtype='object')
  9. There is a column for the scores on the fractions exam, and a column for the scores on the probabilities exam. We want to make each row an observation, so we want to transform this 
table to look like:
full_name	exam	score	gender_age	grade
“First Student”	“Fractions”	score%	…	…
“First Student”	“Probabilities”	score%	…	…
“Second Student”	“Fractions”	score%	…	…
“Second Student”	“Probabilities”	score%	…	…
…	…	…		
Use pd.melt() to create a new table (still called students) that follows this structure.
//
students = pd.melt(frame=students, id_vars=["full_name",'gender_age','grade'], value_vars=["fractions","probability"], value_name="score", var_name="exam")
  10. Print the .head() and the .columns of students. Also, print out the .value_counts() of the column exam.
//
print(students.head())                                          RESULT:

  11. It seems like in the data collection process, some rows may have been recorded twice. Use the .duplicated() function on the students DataFrame to make a Series object called 
duplicates.

  17. It looks like the first character of the values in gender_age contains the gender, while the rest of the string contains the age. Let’s separate out the gender data into a new 
column called gender.
//
students['gender'] = students.gender_age.str[0:1]
  18. Now, separate out the age data into a new column called age.
//
students['age'] = students.gender_age.str[1:]
  19. Good job! Let’s print the .head() of students to see how the DataFrame looks after our creation of new columns.
//

  20. Now, we don’t need that gender_age column anymore. Let’s set the students DataFrame to be the students DataFrame with all columns except gender_age.

  21. The students’ names are stored in a column called full_name. We want to separate this data out into two new columns, first_name and last_name. First, let’s create a Series object 
called name_split that splits the full_name by the " " character.
//
name_split = students['full_name'].str.split(' ')
  22. Now, let’s create a column called first_name that takes the first item in name_split.
//
students['first_name'] = name_split.str.get(0)
  23. Finally, let’s create a column called last_name that takes the second item in name_split.
//
students['last_name'] = name_split.str.get(1)
  24. Print out the .head() of students to see how the DataFrame has changed.

the score column.

  30. Each value in grade looks like “9th grade”, “10th grade”, “11th grade”, or “12th grade”. We want to pare that down to just having the numerical grade. Maybe we want to do linear 
regression on this data, which would require numerical inputs. Use regex to extract the number from each string in grade and store those values back into the grade column.

  32. Convert the grade column to be numerical values instead of objects.
//
This line does that:
students.grade = pd.to_numeric(split_students[1])
  33. Calculate the mean of grade, store it in a variable called avg_grade, and then print it out! We could not have done this with strings like “9th grade” or “10th grade”.
//
avg_grade = students['grade'].mean()
print(avg_grade)                                                RESULT: 10.620445344129555

                                      MISSING VALUES
  34. Get the mean of the score column. Store it in score_mean and print it out.
//
score_mean = students.score.mean()
print(score_mean)                                               RESULT: 77.69657422512235
  35. We will assume that everyone who doesn’t have a score for an exam missed the test. We want to replace all nans with a score of 0. Let’s do this with the score column.
Fill all of the nans in students['score'] with 0.
//
students = students.fillna(value = {'score': 0})
print(students.head())                                          RESULT:

//
score_mean_2 = students.score.mean()
